# <img style="height: 24px; " src="/imgs/allrounder.png"> Allrounder Clan Website 

This Repo is a Website for the Allrounder Clan, also known as the AR Clan.

Everyone is invited to help add and contribute to the website.

## Introduction

The Allrounder was started by 2 friends. Gradually more and more people joined to create this awesome community we have today.

First it started as a Rainbow Six Siege Clan, but to do the name of the clan justice, it quickly branched out into more games or a place to just talk to people.

The Clan welcomes everybody to join, have fun and make friends.
